# Ohpen by VÃ­ctor Cuevas

## Summary

Worked on the test for a bit over the 5 hour mark set. Overall time spent ~6:30 hours - just to be completely transparent about it.
Worked on some unit tests and e2e tests just to give a short presentation about my knowledge of it.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

(Remember to stop ng serve if app is running to avoid haing port conflicts)
## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
